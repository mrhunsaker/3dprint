## Course Description

This course introduces occupational therapy professionals and students to 3D printing as a tool for creating custom adaptive equipment, therapeutic tools, and educational models. Learners with no prior technical experience will gain a basic understanding of 3D‑printing hardware, simple computer‑aided design (CAD) using Tinkercad, and a structured process for translating occupational performance problems into simple 3D‑printed solutions.

The course emphasizes hands‑on learning, clinical reasoning, and iterative design. By the end of the course, participants will have designed and prototyped at least one assistive device or OT‑relevant tool using an FDM (fused deposition modeling) 3D printer.

---

## Course Goals

By the end of this course, participants will be able to:

- Explain in plain language how 3D printing works and identify basic printer components.  
- Safely operate a fused deposition modeling (FDM) printer using pre‑configured settings and a provided workflow.  
- Use beginner‑friendly CAD software (Tinkercad) to design simple assistive devices (e.g., built‑up handles, key turners).  
- Apply OT clinical reasoning to define design requirements based on occupational performance problems and client factors.  
- Collaborate in small teams to design, prototype, and evaluate a simple 3D‑printed device for a case vignette.

---

## Learning Outcomes

Upon successful completion, participants will be able to:

1. Define key terms such as **STL**, **slicer**, **layer height**, **infill**, **support**, and **filament**, and describe the basic 3D‑printing workflow.  
2. Identify at least three potential OT applications of 3D printing in their practice context (e.g., adaptive equipment, therapy tools, educational models).  
3. Create and export at least two simple 3D models in Tinkercad that meet specified size and shape requirements.  
4. Use a provided slicing profile to prepare a model for printing and start a print under supervision, following safety and setup checklists.  
5. Analyze a case scenario, identify an occupational performance barrier, and generate written design criteria (dimensions, grip style, cleaning, safety) for a custom device.  
6. Produce at least one printed prototype, evaluate it against the design criteria, and propose specific modifications for improvement.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## Safety and Ethical Considerations

You may include or adapt the following policy language:

- Students must follow all lab and equipment safety guidelines (hot surfaces, moving parts, electrical safety, and ventilation).  
- Students may not promise or provide 3D‑printed devices directly to real clients without explicit faculty oversight and adherence to institutional policies.  
- Devices produced in this course are prototypes for educational use and are not medical devices cleared by regulatory bodies.  
- Any clinical deployment of designs (e.g., through fieldwork or capstones) should involve appropriate supervision, testing, documentation, and liability review.

### Novice 3D Printing Checklist

**Title:** Novice 3D Printing Checklist (FDM Printer, PLA)

**Purpose:** Step‑by‑step guide for students starting a print using **pre‑configured** slicer profiles.

1. **Before you begin**
    - Confirm instructor permission to use the printer.  
    - Check that the printer is on a stable, non‑flammable surface.  
    - Ensure you have the correct filament (e.g., PLA) and that the spool is not tangled.

2. **Prepare the printer**
    - Turn on the printer using the power switch.  
    - Verify the print bed is clear of previous prints and debris.  
    - If needed, gently clean the bed according to lab guidelines (e.g., wipe with isopropyl alcohol on glass or PEI surfaces).

3. **Load or check filament**
    - Check that filament is correctly loaded through the extruder into the hot end.  
    - If loading new filament:
        - Preheat the nozzle to the filament’s recommended temperature.  
        - Release the extruder clamp, insert filament, and feed until it reaches the hot end.  
        - Extrude a small amount to confirm flow.

4. **Select your file**
    - Insert the SD card/USB drive with the prepared G‑code file.  
    - On the printer’s control screen, navigate to **Print** (or equivalent menu).  
    - Select the correct file (double‑check the file name).

5. **Start the print**
    - Confirm bed and nozzle are heating to the correct temperatures.  
    - Watch the printer lay down the **first 1–2 layers**:
        - Check that filament adheres to the bed.  
        - Confirm lines are not too squished or too loose.  
    - If the first layer fails (not sticking, clumping, or dragging), **pause or stop** the print and ask the instructor for help.

6. **During the print**
    - Do not touch moving parts or hot components.  
    - Observe from a safe distance.  
    - Notify the instructor of any unusual sounds, severe layer shifting, or obvious failure.

7. **After the print finishes**
    - Wait until the bed and nozzle cool to a safe temperature (as instructed).  
    - Carefully remove the print using the provided scraper if needed, aiming to avoid gouging the bed.  
    - Remove any large blobs or filament strings from the area (dispose of properly).  
    - Turn off the printer if you are the last user and instructor consents.

8. **Clean up and document**
    - Put tools back in their designated place.  
    - Label your finished print with your name and project.

---

## 3. STL Quality Checklist (Model Creation)

**Goal:** Ensure the 3D model is technically sound and appropriate for printing and OT use.

- [ ] **Units and scale**  
    - [ ] Model is in millimeters (mm).  
    - [ ] Dimensions match measured requirements (± reasonable tolerance).  

- [ ] **Geometry integrity**  
    - [ ] Solid (no obvious holes in the mesh).

    - [ ] Load‑bearing features (walls, arms, edges) typically ≥ 1.2–1.6 mm thick for PLA, unless intentionally flexible.  
    - [ ] Thin features (tabs, clips) not so thin that they will snap immediately in typical use.  

- [ ] **Clearance and fit**  
    - [ ] Internal holes/slots allow **extra space** beyond object size (e.g., 0.5–1.0 mm total clearance, depending on printer).  
    - [ ] Areas that must slide or clip consider friction and tolerances.  

- [ ] **Comfort and safety**  
    - [ ] Edges rounded or chamfered where hands/fingers contact.  
    - [ ] No unnecessarily sharp points.  
    - [ ] Surfaces large enough for comfortable contact without high pressure.

    - [ ] Thin/weak features are oriented to be as strong as possible in layer direction.  

- [ ] **Naming and versioning**  
    - [ ] File named clearly: `ProjectName_V1.stl`, `V2`, etc.  
    - [ ] Version changes documented (e.g., “V2: increased inner diameter by 1 mm”).  

---

## 4. Slicing Checklist

**Goal:** Prepare a reliable, safe G‑code file with settings appropriate for the part and material.

    - [ ] Finer (0.12–0.16) only if needed for fit or detail, accepting longer print time.  

- [ ] **Infill and walls**  
    - [ ] Infill suitable for strength: typically 15–30% for handles/adapters; higher only if needed.  
    - [ ] Shell/perimeter count enough for durability (e.g., 3–4 perimeters for grips/handles).  

- [ ] **Supports**  
    - [ ] Supports enabled only if needed (overhangs > ~45° or bridging issues).  
    - [ ] Support pattern/placement chosen to avoid damage to critical surfaces.  
    - [ ] Consider using “support blockers” or modifiers if supports are over‑aggressive.  

- [ ] **Bed adhesion**  
    - [ ] Appropriate adhesion method selected (skirt, brim) based on part footprint.  
    - [ ] For small‑footprint parts, brim may help prevent lifting.

### Session 5 – Clinical Reasoning and Design Project (Part 1)

**Duration:** 2–3 hours  
**Focus:** Case analysis and design criteria.

**Learning Objectives**

Learners will be able to:

- Analyze a case vignette to identify the occupational performance problem.  
- Write clear design criteria for a custom device.  
- Begin modeling a device that reflects these criteria.

**Resources**

- **Design Criteria Worksheet** (Section 1.4).  
- OT‑specific contextual readings (optional):  
    - *The Future of Occupational Therapy is 3D‑Printed* – OT program example (University of New England).
    - OT student projects integrating 3D printing into patient care. 
- Assistive device curricula examples:  
    - PrintLab Assistive Device Academy / Make:able challenge toolkit.

**Activities**

1. **Mini‑Lecture (15–20 min)**
    - Discuss how OT evaluates performance problems, client factors, and context.  
    - Connect these to physical device requirements (dimensions, gripping surfaces, etc.).

2. **Case Work in Groups (40–60 min)**
    - Each group receives a different case (RA, hemiparesis, cognitive challenges with medication, etc.).  
    - Groups complete the Design Criteria Worksheet.

3. **Initial Design Modeling (45–60 min)**
    - Groups create first‑pass models in Tinkercad based on their design criteria.  
    - Instructor circulates to provide feedback on feasibility and scope.

4. **Export for Printing (10–15 min)**
    - Groups export STLs and submit them for printing before the next session.

**Duration:** 2–3 hours (plus printing time)  
**Focus:** Prototype testing, evaluation, and course reflection.

**Learning Objectives**

Learners will be able to:

- Test a 3D‑printed prototype against established criteria.  
- Propose clear and realistic design revisions.  
- Reflect on the potential and limitations of 3D printing in OT practice.

**Resources**

- **Prototype Evaluation Form** (Section 1.5).  
- OT/healthcare context videos (optional):  
    - **3D Printing in Healthcare** overview.   
    - **Integrating 3D Printing in Medical Education** – interprofessional context.
- OT‑specific evidence perspective:  
    - Articles such as **“Three‑Dimensional Printing in Clinical Education and Practice”** (ScienceDirect).   

**Activities**

1. **Prototype Distribution and Testing (30–40 min)**
    - Hand out printed prototypes to groups.  
    - Groups test fit and function with real or surrogate objects.

2. **Complete Evaluation Forms (30–40 min)**
    - Using the Prototype Evaluation Form, groups rate fit, comfort, function, and usability.  
    - Groups list at least three specific revisions.

3. **Presentations or Written Summaries (30–40 min)**
    - Each group gives a brief presentation or submits a summary covering:  
        - Case overview.  
        - Device description and intended function.  
        - Test results and revision plan.  
        - Reflection on feasibility and safety in practice.
