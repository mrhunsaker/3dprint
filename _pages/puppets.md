## Video Tutorial

Most of my methods and ideas came from this video, which is worth it for the dad jokes if nothing else.

### Instructions

#### Step 1 — Prepare the Fur and Workspace
Lay out your faux fur squares and gather your sewing tools. Cut the fur pieces according to the Snoof pattern template.

#### Step 2 — Set Up for Sewing

Thread your needle with polyester thread and have your sewing clips within reach. Arrange all cut pieces in order so assembly goes smoothly.

![Sewing setup with thread, needles, and clips ready for snoof assembly](/assets/images/puppets/snoof-sewing-setup.jpeg)


Start by assembling the mouth piece. Use the red and black felt sheets to create the mouth interior. Clip the pieces together before sewing for alignment.

#### Step 4 — Assemble the Body

Sew the fur body panels together, attaching the mouth piece to the front. Use clips to hold seams in place as you work around curves.

#### Step 5 — Place the Eyes

Attach the EVA foam eyeballs with safety eye posts from the inside. Position them symmetrically — the photos below show internal placement from two angles.

- **From Wawak:**
    - Coats and Clark polyester thread (500 yds)

#### Step 1 — Lay Out the Pattern

![Glove puppet felt pieces after cutting](/assets/images/puppets/glove-puppet-cut.jpeg)

#### Step 3 — Attach Eyes and Features
Position the button eyes on the puppet face. To make life easy, attach the eyes **PRIOR** to sewing the pattern together. when you sew the puppet together, the eyes will be on the **inside**

For smaller glove puppets, the photo below shows a suggested eye layout.
